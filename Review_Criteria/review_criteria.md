    "Mechanical Purity": {
      "score": "2",
      "feedback": "While the criteria mention mechanical derivation, they lack specific instructions on demonstrating the *how* and *why* of the connections between core dynamics and manifestations.  The criteria need to be more explicit about the level of detail required to demonstrate a true mechanical link, not just correlation."
    },
    "Internal Focus": {
      "score": "3",
      "feedback": "The criteria adequately address the importance of internal experience, but could be strengthened by explicitly requiring internal dialogue examples to demonstrate this focus."
    },
    "Non-Volitional Nature": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "This criterion is well-defined and generally understood by reviewers."
    },
    "System Integration": {
      "score": "3",
      "feedback": "The criteria could be improved by adding more specific guidance on how to demonstrate the interconnection of different components and their emergent synthesis."
    },
    "Language Purity": {
      "score": "2",
      "feedback": "While the impurities list is helpful, it needs to be more comprehensive. The criteria should also provide positive examples of NEWCORE-compliant language to guide reviewers and content creators."
    },
    "Dualistic Relationship with External Reality": {
      "score": "2",
      "feedback": "The criteria lack specific instructions on how to demonstrate this relationship.  They need to be more explicit about the kinds of examples and explanations required."
    },
    "Depth and Completeness": {
      "score": "3",
      "feedback": "The criteria are adequate but could be more specific about the expected depth of analysis for each section."
    },
    "Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "This criterion is well-defined and encourages deeper exploration of type dynamics."
    },
    "Internal Consistency": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "This criterion is clear and effective."
    },
    "Levels of Health": {
      "score": "2",
      "feedback": "The criteria lack specific guidance on the content and mechanical derivation of health level descriptions. More detailed instructions are needed."
    }
  },
  "detailed_feedback": "The current criteria provide a good foundation but need substantial revision to ensure consistent application and higher quality NEWCORE content. The primary weaknesses are a lack of specificity regarding mechanical derivation, language purity, the dualistic relationship with external reality, and levels of health. The criteria also need to be strengthened by requiring internal dialogue examples and providing more positive examples of NEWCORE-compliant language.",
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Add a sub-criterion to Mechanical Purity focusing on the *mechanism* of action, requiring a step-by-step explanation of the causal chain between core dynamics and manifestations.",
    "Add a sub-criterion to Internal Focus mandating the use of internal dialogue examples.",
    "Expand the IMPURITIES_LIST with commonly used impure terms and provide positive examples of NEWCORE-compliant language. Create a glossary of preferred terms and their mechanical definitions.",
    "Add sub-criteria to Dualistic Relationship with External Reality requiring specific examples of how external stimuli impact internal dynamics and vice-versa.",
    "Refine Levels of Health by providing specific guidelines on what should be included, emphasizing mechanical derivation and differentiation across health levels.",
    "Add a new criterion: Internal Consistency of Mechanisms, to ensure consistent application of mechanical principles throughout the description."
