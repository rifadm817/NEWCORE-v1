  "criteria_scores": {
    "Mechanical Purity": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The new sub-criteria regarding Mechanism of Action and Internal Consistency of Mechanisms significantly strengthen this criterion by demanding explicit demonstration of the causal chain and ensuring consistent application throughout the content."
    },
    "Internal Focus": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "Mandating internal dialogue examples greatly enhances this criterion, ensuring content delves into the subjective experience of each type."
    },
    "Non-Volitional Nature": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While well-defined, providing examples of volitional vs. non-volitional language would further strengthen this criterion."
    },
    "System Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While improved, providing specific examples of what constitutes strong system integration would increase clarity and consistency."
    },
    "Language Purity": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The expanded IMPURITIES_LIST, the NEWCORE Glossary, and the inclusion of positive examples significantly improve this criterion, providing clear guidance on acceptable language."
    },
    "Dualistic Relationship with External Reality": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The added sub-criteria regarding external stimuli/internal dynamics and internal dynamics/external behavior, along with refined guidance, make this criterion much more robust and actionable."
    },
    "Depth and Completeness": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While generally adequate, providing more specific expectations for the depth of analysis in each content section would be beneficial."
    },
    "Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains well-defined, but its effectiveness could be enhanced by providing examples of what constitutes unique insights and nuanced understanding within the NEWCORE framework."
    },
    "Internal Consistency": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion, along with the new 'Internal Consistency of Mechanisms' sub-criterion under Mechanical Purity, ensures a coherent and unified presentation of type dynamics."
    },
    "Levels of Health": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The refined guidance on content, mechanical derivation, and differentiation across health levels significantly strengthens this criterion, ensuring a more comprehensive and accurate portrayal of type development."
    }
  },
  "detailed_feedback": "The proposed revisions comprehensively address the identified weaknesses in the previous version. The new sub-criteria, refined guidance, expanded IMPURITIES_LIST, and the NEWCORE Glossary significantly enhance clarity, consistency, and rigor in applying NEWCORE principles. The emphasis on internal dialogue examples, mechanical derivation, and the dualistic relationship with external reality ensures a deeper and more nuanced understanding of type dynamics.  The recommendation for subtype integration is valuable and should be explored further in future iterations.",
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Provide examples of volitional vs. non-volitional language for the Non-Volitional Nature criterion.",
    "Provide specific examples illustrating strong system integration for the System Integration criterion.",
    "Provide examples of unique insights and nuanced understanding within the NEWCORE framework for the Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding criterion.",
    "Develop more specific expectations for the depth of analysis in each content section for the Depth and Completeness criterion.",
    "Formalize criteria and guidance on subtype integration within the NEWCORE framework."
