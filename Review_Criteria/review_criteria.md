  "criteria_scores": {
    "Mechanical Causality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The insights significantly improve this criterion by adding concrete requirements.  Mandating 'Internal Process Maps' and 'Mechanism of Action' for defenses provides much-needed specificity.  However, the criteria should further clarify the expected level of detail for these elements, including examples."
    },
    "Internal Focus": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The explicit prohibition of external behavior descriptions without a clear internal link, combined with the requirement for sensory details, strengthens this criterion considerably. This addresses a major source of impurity."
    },
    "Non-Volitional Nature": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains well-defined."
    },
    "System Integration": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "Introducing 'Emergent Synthesis' as a distinct criterion with a clear definition and encouragement of visual aids significantly improves the NEWCORE framework's ability to capture the interconnectedness of the Enneagram types' internal dynamics."
    },
    "Language Purity": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The recommendations for expanding the glossary and creating an 'Impurity Table' are excellent. However, the criteria should also specify the process for reviewing and updating these resources to ensure they remain comprehensive and aligned with NEWCORE principles."
    },
    "Dualistic Relationship with External Reality": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "Mandating scenario-based internal dialogues significantly strengthens this criterion by providing concrete examples of the internal-external feedback loop."
    },
    "Depth and Completeness": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "This criterion benefits from the improvements in other areas, but it should explicitly mention the expectation of incorporating the new elements like Internal Process Maps, Mechanisms of Action, and Emergent Synthesis into a comprehensive understanding."
    },
    "Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains relevant and well-defined."
    },
    "Internal Consistency": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains essential."
    },
    "Levels of Health": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The 'Qualitative Shift Matrix' requirement strengthens this criterion by moving beyond simple intensity variations and emphasizing the *how* of these shifts across levels."
    },
    "Subtype Integration": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The 'Subtype Influence Table' with examples and internal dialogues significantly clarifies how subtypes modify core dynamics, moving beyond behavioral descriptions."
    },
    "Internal Timeline": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The requirement for a step-by-step breakdown, including time scales, strengthens the mechanical focus and provides valuable detail about the process of reaction."
    },
    "Cognitive Biases": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "Requiring explicit explanations of the link between biases, core fear, and key process significantly enhances the mechanical understanding of cognitive biases within the NEWCORE framework."
    },
    "Emergent Synthesis": {
      "score": "N/A",
      "feedback": "This new criterion is crucial for ensuring a holistic understanding of the type's internal system. The definition and encouragement of visual aids are well-considered."
    }
  },
  "detailed_feedback": "Version 9 represents a substantial improvement in the NEWCORE criteria. The insights are effectively integrated, addressing key weaknesses and promoting greater clarity and consistency.  The new criteria, particularly 'Emergent Synthesis,' and the refined requirements for existing criteria significantly enhance the framework's ability to ensure content purity and facilitate nuanced understanding of the Enneagram.  The focus on concrete examples, visual aids, and structured tables will greatly aid content creators and reviewers.",
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Provide detailed examples of Internal Process Maps, Mechanisms of Action, Qualitative Shift Matrices, and Subtype Influence Tables within the criteria or accompanying documentation.",
    "Develop a clear process for reviewing and updating the glossary and 'Impurity Table' to ensure they remain comprehensive and aligned with evolving NEWCORE understanding.",
    "Develop and disseminate exemplar content showcasing best practices for each criterion across different Enneagram types.",
    "Create a structured online platform or collaborative space for reviewers and content creators to discuss and refine NEWCORE criteria and best practices."
