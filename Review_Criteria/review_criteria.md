    "Mechanical Causality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While the emphasis on Internal Process Chain Analysis is excellent, the provided examples lack the depth and rigor needed to truly exemplify mechanical purity. More detailed breakdowns, demonstrating the precise causal link between each step in the chain, are required."
    },
    "Internal Focus": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion is well-defined and effectively addressed in the new insights."
    },
    "Non-Volitional Nature": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While the concept is understood, the practical application needs strengthening.  The new insights should explicitly address how to avoid volitional language in describing internal processes and reactions."
    },
    "System Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The inclusion of System Dynamics Diagrams is a significant improvement. However, clear guidelines and templates for their creation are missing.  The 'Emergent Synthesis Narrative' needs further definition regarding its scope and purpose."
    },
    "Language Purity": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Addressing the Impurity Table is crucial. The new insights correctly identify this ongoing challenge.  However, a concrete plan for regular review, community input, and dissemination of updates is needed."
    },
    "Dualistic Relationship with External Reality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The new insights should emphasize how to demonstrate this dynamic interplay more effectively. Specific examples of how internal processes influence external interactions and vice-versa are needed."
    },
    "Depth and Completeness": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While the new insights aim for greater depth, the practical implementation requires more specific guidelines and examples to ensure consistent application across all criteria."
    },
    "Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The new insights adequately address this criterion."
    },
    "Internal Consistency": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains essential and is well-addressed."
    },
    "Levels of Health": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While the concept is sound, practical application needs improvement.  Specific templates or structured approaches for demonstrating shifts in internal processes across levels of health are required."
    },
    "Subtype Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Similar to System Dynamics Diagrams, Subtype Influence Diagrams require clearer guidelines and templates for their creation and interpretation."
    },
    "Internal Timeline": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "This criterion needs further clarification.  How should content creators demonstrate the unfolding of internal processes over time?"
    },
    "Cognitive Biases": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The connection between cognitive biases and core fears/desires needs more explicit explanation.  Provide examples of how specific biases manifest mechanically for each type."
    },
    "Emergent Synthesis": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The new insights highlight the importance of this criterion, but practical application needs strengthening. Clearer guidelines and examples are needed for demonstrating emergent synthesis effectively."
    },
    "Interaction of Internal Worlds": {
      "score": "N/A",
      "feedback": "This is a valuable new criterion that addresses a significant gap.  Its inclusion will greatly enhance the understanding of interpersonal dynamics within the Enneagram."
    }
  },
  "detailed_feedback": "Version 11 builds upon the progress of Version 10, incorporating valuable insights and addressing key challenges. However, the practical application of these insights requires more specific guidelines, templates, and examples.  The introduction of the 'Interaction of Internal Worlds' criterion is a significant improvement.  Overall, Version 11 shows promise but needs further refinement to ensure consistent and effective implementation.",
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Develop standardized templates for Internal Process Chain Analysis, System Dynamics Diagrams, Subtype Influence Diagrams, Levels of Health analysis, and the new 'Interaction of Internal Worlds' criterion.",
    "Expand the Impurity Table and establish a clear process for its regular review, update, and community input.",
    "Create a comprehensive online platform with resources, including templates, examples, and forums for discussion.",
    "Develop a reviewer checklist to ensure consistent application of all criteria.",
    "Provide clear examples demonstrating the non-volitional nature of internal processes and how to avoid volitional language.",
    "Clarify the scope and purpose of the 'Emergent Synthesis Narrative' and its relationship to System Dynamics Diagrams."
