- Clear and logical cause-and-effect relationships must be established
- Evaluate how well the content demonstrates the mechanical link between core dynamics and manifestations

2. Internal Focus (Score 1-5)
- Strong emphasis on internal experiences over external behaviors
- Detailed description of thought processes, emotional patterns, and internal dialogues
- Minimal reference to social roles or outcomes unless directly tied to internal experiences
- Assess the depth of exploration of the type's inner world

- Exploration of the feedback loop between internal states and external behaviors/responses
- Assess the depth of analysis of this internal-external interplay

7. Depth and Completeness (Score 1-5)
- All required sections must be present and fully developed
- Each section should provide detailed examples and thorough explanations
- Consistent depth of analysis across all aspects of the description
- Evaluate the overall comprehensiveness of the content

8. Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding (Score 1-5)
- Presence of novel insights or particularly nuanced understanding of the type
- Evidence of deep, critical thinking about the implications of core dynamics
- Exploration of complex interactions and subtle manifestations of type dynamics
- Assess the originality and depth of insights provided

9. Internal Consistency (Score 1-5)
- No contradictions or inconsistencies in how the type is portrayed
- Coherent narrative throughout the description
- Logical flow from core dynamics to manifestations
- Evaluate the overall consistency of the type portrayal

10. Levels of Health (Score 1-5)
- Clear differentiation of internal experiences at different levels of health
- Mechanical derivation of health levels from core fears and desires
- Detailed exploration of how core dynamics manifest across the health spectrum
- Assess the depth and accuracy of health level descriptions

Additional Review Tasks:
1. Word Count: Ensure the description meets the minimum word count (2000 for single types, 2500 for tritypes)
2. Section Completeness: Check that all required sections are present and fully developed
3. Examples and Illustrations: Evaluate the quality and relevance of examples provided
4. Impurities Check: Identify any instances of impurities as listed in the IMPURITIES_LIST
5. Tritype Integration (for tritype descriptions): Assess how well the three types are integrated and their interactions explained

Provide a comprehensive review including:
1. Detailed scores and examples for each criterion
2. An overall assessment of the content's adherence to NEWCORE principles
3. A clear decision on whether the content needs revision (yes/no)
4. If revision is needed, provide specific, section-by-section guidance for improvement
5. Highlight any particularly strong aspects of the description that should be maintained or expanded upon

Remember to think critically and creatively. Look for subtle deviations from NEWCORE principles and consider implications that may not be immediately obvious. Your goal is to ensure the highest possible quality and purity of NEWCORE descriptions.
