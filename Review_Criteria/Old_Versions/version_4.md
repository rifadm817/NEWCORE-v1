  "criteria_scores": {
    "Mechanical Purity": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While the current criteria mention Mechanism of Action and Internal Consistency of Mechanisms, the proposed reframing to 'Mechanical Causality' and the addition of sub-criteria (Internal Triggers, Process Steps, Feedback Loops) would significantly strengthen this criterion by providing more specific guidance on demonstrating the causal chain."
    },
    "Internal Focus": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The requirement for internal dialogue examples is good, but the proposed enhancement to explicitly guide against behavioral descriptions and mandate at least three examples per type/comparison will further solidify this criterion."
    },
    "Non-Volitional Nature": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Remains important.  Needs further development with specific examples of volitional vs. non-volitional language to enhance clarity and application."
    },
    "System Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Still requires specific examples to improve clarity and consistency in its application."
    },
    "Language Purity": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "The expanded IMPURITIES_LIST and NEWCORE Glossary provide robust guidance and should be continuously updated as needed."
    },
    "Dualistic Relationship with External Reality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The proposed expansion with sub-criteria (Perception Filtering, Behavioral Manifestation, External Feedback Loop) and the requirement of scenario examples will strengthen this criterion significantly by providing more concrete guidance."
    },
    "Depth and Completeness": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The suggestion to provide specific word count or content length expectations is a valuable improvement that would make this criterion more actionable."
    },
    "Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Providing clear examples of what constitutes unique insights and nuanced understanding within the NEWCORE framework, as suggested, will significantly improve the application of this criterion."
    },
    "Internal Consistency": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "Remains important and well-defined.  Its effectiveness is amplified by the proposed changes to Mechanical Purity."
    },
    "Levels of Health": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While previously scored as a 5, the lack of concrete implementation details necessitates a slightly lower score.  Further refinement is needed to ensure consistent application."
    },
    "Subtype Integration": {
      "score": "N/A",
      "feedback": "The proposed introduction of this criterion is crucial for a comprehensive NEWCORE analysis and addresses a significant gap in the current framework.  The suggested sub-criteria provide a strong foundation."
    }
  },
  "detailed_feedback": "The proposed Version 4 revisions demonstrate a strong understanding of the current criteria's limitations and offer practical solutions to enhance clarity, consistency, and rigor. The emphasis on mechanical causality, internal experience, subtype integration, and providing concrete examples throughout the criteria will significantly improve NEWCORE content review and ensure adherence to its core principles.  The recommendations regarding word count expectations and continued glossary expansion are particularly valuable for ensuring consistent application across different content types.",
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Implement the reframing of 'Mechanical Purity' to 'Mechanical Causality' and incorporate the sub-criteria: Internal Triggers, Process Steps, and Feedback Loops.",
    "Enhance 'Internal Focus' by explicitly guiding against behavioral descriptions and mandating at least three internal dialogue examples per type/comparison.",
    "Provide specific examples of volitional vs. non-volitional language for the 'Non-Volitional Nature' criterion.",
    "Develop concrete examples illustrating strong system integration for the 'System Integration' criterion.",
    "Implement the expansion of 'Dualistic Relationship with External Reality' with the sub-criteria: Perception Filtering, Behavioral Manifestation, and External Feedback Loop, including the requirement for scenario examples.",
    "Define specific word count or content length expectations for each section of a NEWCORE analysis for the 'Depth and Completeness' criterion.",
    "Provide clear examples of unique insights and nuanced understanding within the NEWCORE framework for the 'Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding' criterion.",
    "Develop detailed guidance for the application of the 'Levels of Health' criterion, including specific examples of what constitutes strong content at each level.",
    "Formalize the 'Subtype Integration' criterion with the proposed sub-criteria: Subtype Influence on Core Dynamics, Subtype-Specific Manifestations, and Interaction Dynamics between Subtypes."
