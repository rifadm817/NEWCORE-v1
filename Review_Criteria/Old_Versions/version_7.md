    "Mechanical Causality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Version 6 identified the need for deeper mechanical explanations, and Version 7 proposes valuable sub-criteria like 'Internal Process Mapping' and 'Mechanism of Action.'  However, the criteria still lack specific examples demonstrating how to apply these sub-criteria effectively.  This makes it challenging for content creators to understand the level of detail required and for reviewers to assess compliance consistently."
    },
    "Internal Focus": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While 'Internal Experience Focus' is a valuable addition, the criteria should further emphasize distinguishing between internal experiences and externally observable behaviors.  More examples illustrating this distinction are needed."
    },
    "Non-Volitional Nature": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains well-defined and effectively applied."
    },
    "System Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The suggestion to encourage visual aids is helpful, but the criteria should provide more guidance on *what* constitutes effective system integration.  Define 'Emergent Synthesis' more concretely and provide specific examples of how to demonstrate it."
    },
    "Language Purity": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Expanding the glossary is crucial.  Prioritize terms commonly misused in Enneagram discussions, focusing on mechanically derived definitions. The criteria should also offer examples of pure vs. impure language for common concepts."
    },
    "Dualistic Relationship with External Reality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Mandating internal dialogue and introducing the 'Internal-External Feedback Loop' are valuable additions.  However, the criteria should provide clear examples of how to effectively illustrate these concepts for different types."
    },
    "Depth and Completeness": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion functions effectively, especially with the added requirements in other areas enriching content."
    },
    "Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains well-defined and effectively promotes insightful analysis."
    },
    "Internal Consistency": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion effectively ensures logical coherence."
    },
    "Levels of Health": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The proposed sub-criteria for each level of health provide valuable structure.  However, the criteria need specific examples demonstrating the qualitative shifts in internal experience across levels.  Simply stating intensity is insufficient."
    },
    "Subtype Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While mandating subtype influence analysis is a step forward, the criteria should offer specific examples illustrating how each subtype nuances the core dynamics for each type.  Clearly defined sub-criteria for each subtype are also needed."
    }
  },
  "detailed_feedback": "Version 7 builds upon Version 6 by introducing crucial sub-criteria and clarifying expectations. However, the primary weakness remains the lack of concrete examples demonstrating how to apply these enhanced criteria effectively.  Providing comprehensive exemplar content for each criterion and sub-criterion is essential for ensuring consistent application and achieving NEWCORE purity.",
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Develop comprehensive exemplar content for *all* criteria and sub-criteria, illustrating both correct and incorrect applications. This includes specific examples of Internal Process Mapping, Mechanism of Action for defense mechanisms, Internal Experience Focus, Emergent Synthesis, Internal-External Feedback Loops, Levels of Health sub-criteria (with qualitative descriptions of internal shifts), and Subtype Integration sub-criteria (demonstrating nuanced subtype influence).",
    "Expand the glossary with mechanically derived definitions for commonly misused terms (e.g., 'success,' 'value,' 'attention,' 'manipulation'), providing examples of pure and impure usage.",
    "Provide clear examples of how visual aids (e.g., flowcharts, diagrams) can be used to illustrate system integration and internal processes for different Enneagram types.",
    "Create a dedicated section with examples of internal dialogue for each Enneagram type, demonstrating how their internal world shapes their perception and reaction to external situations.",
    "Establish a clear feedback mechanism for reviewers and content creators to contribute to the ongoing refinement of the NEWCORE criteria and exemplar content."
