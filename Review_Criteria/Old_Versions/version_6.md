  "criteria_scores": {
    "Mechanical Causality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While Version 5 improved clarity, the new insights reveal a need for deeper mechanical explanations.  Content often *states* connections between core dynamics and behavior without fully explaining the *how* and *why*. The proposed 'Internal Process Mapping' sub-criterion directly addresses this gap."
    },
    "Internal Focus": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The insights highlight the persistent challenge of maintaining an internal focus.  The proposed 'Internal Experience Focus' sub-criterion under Language Purity strengthens this area by explicitly requiring descriptions of subjective experience."
    },
    "Non-Volitional Nature": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains well-defined and effectively applied."
    },
    "System Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The new insights reinforce the need for clearer examples and a more holistic understanding of system integration.  The proposed visual aids and 'Emergent Synthesis' explanation directly address this weakness."
    },
    "Language Purity": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The insights confirm that impure language remains a significant issue.  Expanding the glossary and introducing the 'Internal Experience Focus' sub-criterion will further strengthen language purity."
    },
    "Dualistic Relationship with External Reality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While Version 5 improved this area, the insights highlight the need for more concrete examples and internal dialogue to illustrate the dynamic interplay between internal and external realities.  The proposed sub-criterion and mandated internal dialogue examples address this."
    },
    "Depth and Completeness": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion functions effectively."
    },
    "Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains well-defined and effectively promotes insightful analysis."
    },
    "Internal Consistency": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion effectively ensures logical coherence."
    },
    "Levels of Health": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The insights reveal that this criterion is often underdeveloped. The proposed sub-criteria and exemplar content provide the necessary structure and guidance for improvement."
    },
    "Subtype Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While present in Version 5, the insights suggest that subtype integration is underutilized. The proposed examples and refined feedback prompts will enhance its application."
    }
  },
  "detailed_feedback": "Version 6 builds upon the strengths of Version 5 while addressing key weaknesses identified in the meta-review analysis. The proposed changes aim to deepen mechanical understanding, strengthen language purity, enhance system integration, clarify the application of levels of health and subtype integration, and further refine the depiction of the dualistic relationship with external reality.  These enhancements will lead to more rigorous, insightful, and NEWCORE-compliant content.",
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Develop comprehensive exemplar content for all criteria, including specific examples of Internal Process Mapping, Internal Experience Focus, Internal-External Feedback Loops, Levels of Health sub-criteria, and Subtype Integration.",
    "Create visual aids and flowcharts illustrating system integration for different Enneagram types.",
    "Continuously monitor the application of the new criteria and solicit feedback from reviewers and content creators to identify areas for further refinement."
