    "Mechanical Causality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Version 7 and the new insights correctly identify the need for deeper mechanical explanations. While 'Internal Process Mapping' and 'Mechanism of Action' are valuable, the criteria still lack the required specificity.  The new insights begin to address this by suggesting visual aids and step-by-step process explanations, but these need to be formalized within the criteria itself."
    },
    "Internal Focus": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The emphasis on internal experience is positive. However, the criteria must explicitly prohibit descriptions of external behaviors unless they are directly and demonstrably linked to internal processes.  The insights' suggestion of using sensory details is helpful and should be incorporated."
    },
    "Non-Volitional Nature": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains well-defined."
    },
    "System Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The insights regarding 'Emergent Synthesis' and visual aids are crucial and need to be integrated into the criteria.  The criteria should define 'Emergent Synthesis' as the demonstrable interconnectedness of core fear, desire, key process, and defenses, resulting in the unique pattern of each type."
    },
    "Language Purity": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Expanding the glossary with mechanically derived definitions is vital.  The insights correctly identify common impurities.  The criteria should explicitly prohibit the use of these terms unless they are redefined within a NEWCORE framework and their mechanical link is clearly established."
    },
    "Dualistic Relationship with External Reality": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "Mandating internal dialogue and the 'Internal-External Feedback Loop' are excellent additions.  The insights' suggestion of concrete scenarios with internal dialogues should be formalized in the criteria."
    },
    "Depth and Completeness": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "While generally effective, this criterion now needs to incorporate the increased depth required by other criteria, especially concerning mechanical causality, internal focus, and language purity.  Content must demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the internal dynamics."
    },
    "Unique Insights and Nuanced Understanding": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains relevant and well-defined."
    },
    "Internal Consistency": {
      "score": "5",
      "feedback": "This criterion remains essential."
    },
    "Levels of Health": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The insights regarding qualitative shifts and internal dialogues are critical. The criteria should require detailed descriptions of how the core fear, desire, and defenses manifest differently across levels, moving beyond intensity."
    },
    "Subtype Integration": {
      "score": "4",
      "feedback": "The insights' focus on how subtypes modify core dynamics is crucial. The criteria should mandate examples and internal dialogues demonstrating the nuanced influence of each subtype, not just behavioral differences."
    },
    "Internal Timeline": {
      "score": "N/A",
      "feedback": "This new criterion is essential for emphasizing the *process* of reaction, from initial trigger to behavior.  It strengthens the mechanical focus and discourages simple behavioral labeling."
    },
    "Cognitive Biases": {
      "score": "N/A",
      "feedback": "This proposed criterion adds significant depth by linking cognitive biases to the core fear and key process. It enhances the mechanical understanding and provides new avenues for insightful analysis."
    }
  },
  "detailed_feedback": "Version 8 builds upon previous iterations by focusing on the *how* and *why* of internal dynamics.  The new insights provide valuable direction, particularly regarding exemplar content, mechanical causality, and language purity. The addition of 'Internal Timeline' and 'Cognitive Biases' significantly strengthens the NEWCORE framework.  The key improvement is the formalization of these insights into explicit criteria, enabling clearer evaluation and promoting higher content purity.",
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "Formalize the insights' recommendations into specific requirements within each criterion.  This includes mandating internal dialogues, visual aids where appropriate, step-by-step process explanations, and detailed descriptions of qualitative shifts in levels of health and subtype influence.",
    "Expand the glossary with mechanically derived definitions for commonly misused terms, and explicitly prohibit impure language unless redefined within the NEWCORE framework.",
    "Provide detailed exemplar content demonstrating the correct application of each criterion, including examples of internal process maps, mechanism of action for defenses, internal-external feedback loops, levels of health, subtype integration, internal timelines, and cognitive biases.",
    "Develop a structured feedback mechanism (e.g., online platform) for reviewers and content creators to contribute to the ongoing refinement of the NEWCORE criteria and exemplar content."
