## NEWCORE Comparison: Enneagram Type 1 vs. Type 3

Both Type 1 and Type 3 automatically respond to a core wound of perceived inadequacy. This comparison explores the distinct, automatic internal responses arising from this wound within the NEWCORE framework.

**1. Core Fear and Desire:**

| Feature | Type 1 | Type 3 |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Fear** | Experiencing internal incongruence, deviating from an automatically generated internal ideal. | Experiencing a perceived absence of inherent value. |
| **Core Desire** | To maintain a perceived state of internal congruence with the automatically generated internal ideal. | To achieve a perception of inherent value. |

**2. Internal Process Chain Analysis:**

**Type 1:**

1. **Trigger:** Perception of a discrepancy between internal state and the internal ideal. Example: Noticing a stain on their shirt.
2. **Internal Experience:** Automatic generation of a feeling of dissonance and agitation. This feeling is not a conscious choice but an involuntary reaction to the perceived discrepancy.  This arises directly from the core fear of incongruence.
3. **Automatic Response:** Automatic initiation of self-criticism and corrective behavior.  This automatic response attempts to alleviate the core fear. Example: An internal narrative arises: "This stain represents a deviation from my ideal." followed by immediately cleaning the stain. This action aims to restore congruence.
4. **Reinforcement:** Temporary alleviation of the feeling of dissonance, reinforcing the automatic self-correction process. This reinforces the perception that maintaining congruence with the internal ideal is essential for mitigating internal distress. This strengthens the connection between congruence and a reduction in the experience of the core fear.

**Type 3:**

1. **Trigger:** Perception of a lack of positive external feedback. Example: Not receiving praise for a presentation at work.
2. **Internal Experience:** Automatic generation of a feeling of emptiness. This is an involuntary response to the perceived absence of validation, directly linked to the core fear of lacking inherent value.  This is not a conscious feeling of sadness or depression.
3. **Automatic Response:** Automatic adjustment of self-presentation and pursuit of achievements to elicit external validation. This automatic response aims to counteract the core fear. Example: An internal narrative arises: "Lack of praise means I need to demonstrate more value." followed by planning to highlight accomplishments in the next meeting.  This action aims to gain external validation and thus, a sense of value.
4. **Reinforcement:** Reception of positive external feedback, temporarily alleviating the feeling of emptiness and reinforcing the automatic image-crafting process.  This reinforces the belief that external validation is necessary for mitigating the feeling of emptiness, strengthening the link between external feedback and a reduction in the experience of the core fear.


**3. Key Process Distinctions (Mechanism of Action):**

| Type | Key Process | Mechanism of Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Self-Correction | Automatically scanning for perceived internal discrepancies and engaging in corrective actions to maintain perceived alignment with the internal ideal. This directly stems from the core fear of incongruence and the core desire for congruence. |
| 3 | Image Crafting | Automatically monitoring external feedback and adjusting self-presentation to elicit validation and achieve a perception of value. This is a direct response to the core fear of lacking value and the core desire to attain it. |


**4. Defensive Mechanism Contrasts:**

| Defense Mechanism | Type 1 | Type 3 |
|---|---|---|
| **Reaction Formation** | Automatically transforming perceived internal impulses into their opposite to maintain congruence with the internal ideal.  This automatic response arises from the core fear of incongruence. Example: Expressing exaggerated patience while experiencing automatic agitation due to a perceived internal flaw (impatience). | Automatically feigning humility while internally driven by the automatic desire for perceived value. This arises from the core fear of being seen as valueless if the drive for achievement is too overt. Example: Downplaying achievements while subtly ensuring they are acknowledged. |
| **Repression** | Automatically suppressing internal experiences perceived as incongruent with the internal ideal. This is an automatic attempt to avoid experiencing the core fear. Example: Automatically suppressing feelings of anger because anger is perceived as incongruent with the internal ideal.  | Automatically suppressing feelings of emptiness and perceived lack of value. This automatic response aims to avoid the core fear. Example: Hiding anxieties about a project for fear that failure would confirm their lack of value. |


**5. Levels of Health:**

**(Detailed descriptions of how the core fear and automatic responses manifest at each level of health for both types.  Includes examples of internal dialogues and internal process chain analyses at each level.  Examples show how the intensity of automatic responses and the rigidity of the internal ideal/need for validation shift across levels.  For example, a healthy 1 might experience milder agitation and be more flexible with their internal ideal, while an unhealthy 1 might experience extreme agitation and rigidly adhere to their ideal.)**

**6. Subtype Integration (Subtype Influence Diagrams):**

**(Visual diagrams illustrating the internal shifts caused by each subtype for both types. These diagrams map how the core fear and desire manifest differently based on the dominant instinctual drive, showcasing the nuances of each subtype.  For example, a self-preservation 1 might focus their self-correction on physical health and resources, while a social 1 might focus on correcting social injustices.)**


**7. Internal Timeline:**

**(Descriptions of how each type automatically experiences the past, present, and future in relation to their core fear and desire. For Type 1, the past might be automatically scanned for past mistakes and areas needing correction, driven by the core fear of past incongruence. For Type 3, the past might be automatically edited to highlight successes and create a narrative of value, driven by the core fear of appearing valueless.)**

**8. Cognitive Biases:**

**(Specific cognitive biases stemming from the core fear and desire of each type. For example, Type 1 might automatically exhibit a negativity bias towards self-perception, constantly scanning for flaws due to the core fear of incongruence. Type 3 might automatically exhibit a confirmation bias towards positive external feedback, filtering out criticism due to the core fear of lacking value.)**

**9. Potential Misidentification Factors:**

* **Individuals experiencing Three's automatic drive for perceived value can appear principled, mimicking One's automatic drive for internal congruence.**  The distinction lies in the underlying motivation: external validation versus internal congruence.  Both stem from a perceived inadequacy, but Three seeks to alleviate this through external means, while One seeks internal alignment.
* **Individuals experiencing One's automatic focus on correcting perceived external imperfections can resemble Three's automatic pursuit of external markers of value.** The difference is the source of the drive: an internal need for congruence versus a need for external validation. One corrects external imperfections to align the external world with their internal ideal, while Three pursues external markers of value to gain external validation.

**10. Interaction of Internal Worlds (Scenarios with Internal Dialogues and Internal Process Chain Analyses):**

**(Specific scenarios illustrating interactions between the two types, with internal dialogues and internal process chain analyses for each type.  Example: A Type 1 and Type 3 collaborate on a project. The Type 1 automatically focuses on correcting perceived imperfections in the project, driven by their core fear of incongruence.  Their internal dialogue might include:  "This report needs to be flawless.  We need to revise this section to ensure it aligns with best practices."  The Type 3 automatically focuses on how the project will be perceived by others and how it can enhance their image, driven by their core fear of lacking value. Their internal dialogue might include: "This project needs to impress the stakeholders.  We need to highlight the innovative aspects and ensure it's presented in a compelling way.")**

**11. Emergent Synthesis (System Dynamics Diagram and Narrative):**

**(A visual system dynamics diagram and accompanying narrative illustrating the interconnectedness of each type's internal system. The diagram would visually represent the feedback loops between core fear, core desire, automatic responses, and reinforcement mechanisms. The narrative would describe how these elements interact to create the overall pattern of each type. For example, for Type 1, the narrative would describe how the core fear of incongruence drives the automatic response of self-correction, which, when reinforced, strengthens the belief in the necessity of maintaining congruence with the internal ideal, thus perpetuating the cycle.)**


This NEWCORE comparison clarifies the fundamental differences between Type 1 and Type 3 by focusing on their automatic internal mechanics. This elucidation clarifies potential points of confusion and provides a deeper understanding of their distinct internal experiences and resulting automatic behaviors.
