## NEWCORE Comparison: Enneagram Type 6 vs. Type 8

Both Type 6 and Type 8 experience a core wound related to perceived danger and a lack of safety, leading to distinct internal worlds and reactive processes.  This comparison examines their key differences through the NEWCORE lens.

**1. Core Fear and Desire Differences:**

While both types fear vulnerability, the nature and source of this fear differ significantly.

* **Type 6:**  The core fear centers around being abandoned and unsupported in a threatening world, leading to a desire for external validation, reassurance, and strong alliances.  Their fear is more diffuse, focused on a general sense of insecurity and the need for external structures to provide safety.

* **Type 8:** The core fear revolves around being controlled or dominated, stemming from a perceived betrayal of trust and vulnerability.  This generates a desire for autonomy, self-reliance, and control over their environment. Their fear is more focused on interpersonal dynamics and the potential for exploitation.

**2. Key Process Distinctions:**

* **Type 6:**  Engages in a continuous cycle of scanning for potential threats, seeking reassurance, testing the loyalty of perceived allies, and preparing for worst-case scenarios. This process is driven by the need to mitigate their pervasive sense of insecurity.

* **Type 8:**  Focuses on asserting control and preemptively neutralizing perceived dangers. This involves continuous vigilance for potential power imbalances and taking action to establish dominance, driven by the need to prevent being controlled.

**3. Defensive Mechanism Contrasts:**

While both types utilize defense mechanisms, their strategies differ based on their core fears.

* **Type 6:**  May employ projection (attributing their anxieties onto others), reaction formation (appearing overly confident when insecure), and intellectualization (analyzing threats to neutralize emotional impact). These mechanisms aim to manage their anxiety and maintain a sense of security, often through external validation.

* **Type 8:**  May utilize denial of vulnerability, projection of aggression, and suppression of emotions perceived as weak. These mechanisms aim to maintain a sense of control and prevent others from exploiting perceived weaknesses.

**4. Potential Misidentification Factors:**

* **6 and 8:** Both types can appear assertive, especially when feeling threatened. However, the underlying motivation differs. Sixes' assertiveness is often a reactive response to perceived danger, aiming to secure their position within a support system or establish clear boundaries. Eights' assertiveness stems from a proactive need to establish control and dominance.

* **6 and other "compliant" types (1, 2, 9):** Sixes can be mistaken for other compliant types due to their desire for external validation.  However, unlike One's internalized sense of "rightness," Two's need to be needed, or Nine's desire for harmony, Sixes seek validation primarily to alleviate their core fear of being unsupported in a dangerous world.

* **8 and other "assertive" types (3, 7):** Eights can be mistaken for Threes due to their focus on achieving goals.  However, Eights' motivation stems from a need for control and autonomy, while Threes' drive is rooted in a desire for external validation and admiration.  Eights can also be confused with Sevens, but Eightsâ€™ focus is on controlling their environment, while Sevens focus on avoiding internal pain and seeking pleasurable experiences.


**5. Interaction of Internal Worlds:**

When a Six and an Eight interact, the Six's need for reassurance and the Eight's need for control can create a complex dynamic. The Six may perceive the Eight as a potential source of protection, but also as a potential threat to their autonomy. The Eight may view the Six's anxiety as a weakness, while also appreciating their loyalty and support.  This dynamic can lead to either a mutually beneficial alliance or a power struggle, depending on the individuals' levels of health and the specific context of the interaction.  The Six might test the Eight's loyalty, which the Eight might perceive as a challenge to their authority. Conversely, the Eight's assertiveness might trigger the Six's anxiety, leading to increased vigilance and a need for reassurance. This continuous feedback loop shapes the ongoing interaction.
