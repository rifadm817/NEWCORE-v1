## NEWCORE Enneagram Type 1 vs. Type 4 Comparison

**1. Core Fear**

**Type 1:** Experiencing a fundamental sense of brokenness. This manifests as an automatic, continuous internal scan for perceived imperfections in self and surroundings.

**Type 4:** Experiencing a fundamental sense of lack. This manifests as interconnected, automatic fears of ordinariness, abandonment, and being misunderstood, stemming from the central perception of inherent deficiency.

**Key Differences:** Both types perceive a fundamental flaw. Type 1 automatically reacts to the perceived internal damage, focusing on correcting perceived flaws. Type 4 automatically reacts to the perceived internal emptiness, focusing on compensating for the perceived lack through external experiences and expressions.


**2. Core Desire**

**Type 1:** To achieve a state of wholeness. This manifests as an automatic, relentless pursuit of an idealized internal state, driven by the need to escape the feeling of being broken.

**Type 4:** To achieve a sense of significance and deep connection. This manifests as an automatic pursuit of experiences and expressions that counteract the feeling of lack.

**Key Differences:** Type 1 automatically pursues wholeness through internal self-correction and adherence to an internalized ideal. Type 4 automatically pursues wholeness through seeking external validation and expressing their perceived inner world to establish connection.


**3. Key Process**

**Type 1:** Self-regulation. This continuous, automatic internal process monitors, evaluates, and corrects against an internalized ideal, driven by the need to minimize the perceived discrepancy between the self and the idealized self-image.

**Type 4:** Introjection. This unconscious, automatic process internalizes perceived ideal images and qualities from external sources, attempting to compensate for the perceived internal lack and establish a sense of identity.

**Key Differences:** Type 1's automatic process is internally driven by self-correction according to an internal standard. Type 4's automatic process is externally driven by incorporating perceived ideal qualities to compensate for the perceived internal lack.


**4. Defensive Mechanisms**

**Type 1:** Reaction formation, isolation of affect, intellectualization, and displacement. These mechanisms automatically manage the discomfort stemming from the perception of brokenness.

**Type 4:** Idealization, devaluation, melancholy, and withdrawal. These mechanisms automatically respond to the fear of lack and the perceived threat of ordinariness and abandonment.

**Key Differences:** Type 1's defenses automatically manage internal discomfort arising from perceived flaws. Type 4's defenses automatically manage the perceived external threats to their sense of self, stemming from the fear of lack.


**5. Potential Misidentification Factors**

**Type 1:** May be mistaken for other types due to automatic responses that resemble the pursuit of external achievement (Three) or adherence to familiar patterns (Six). However, these automatic responses originate from the internal fear of brokenness and the automatic drive for self-correction.

**Type 4:** May be mistaken for other types due to automatic responses that resemble the exploration of self-understanding (Five) or a focus on relationships (Two). However, these automatic responses originate from the internal fear of lack and the automatic drive to establish connection.

**Key Differences:** Misidentification arises from focusing on automatic responses rather than the originating fear. Type 1's automatic striving for self-correction can resemble other types' external behaviors. Type 4's automatic pursuit of connection can resemble other types' interpersonal strategies.


**6. Interaction of Internal Worlds**

**Type 1:** When interacting with a Type 4, the Type 1 may automatically experience the 4's expression of intense emotions as internally dysregulating and their focus on self-expression as disruptive to their automatic sense of internal order.

**Type 4:** When interacting with a Type 1, the Type 4 may automatically experience the 1's adherence to established patterns as internally constricting and their focus on self-control as a barrier to authentic connection, hindering their automatic pursuit of interaction.

**Key Differences:** Interaction can be challenging due to contrasting automatic responses to core fears. The 1's automatic self-regulation can clash with the 4's automatic self-expression, leading to automatic misunderstandings if both types are not aware of their differing internal processes and automatic reactions.
