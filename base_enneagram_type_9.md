## NEWCORE Enneagram Type 9: The Peacemaker (Internal World Focus)

**1. Core Wound:**

The core wound of the Nine originates from a perceived early childhood experience of being overlooked, disregarded, or insignificant in their environment. This doesn't necessarily mean outright neglect, but rather a consistent experience of their needs and desires being subsumed by the needs and demands of others or the general atmosphere of the environment.  This leads to a sense of their own inner world being less important, real, or valid than the external world.

* **Example 1:** A child repeatedly expresses a desire to play a specific game, but the family consistently chooses other activities, leaving the child feeling unseen and unheard.  The child internalizes this as, "My wants don't matter."
* **Example 2:** A child witnesses frequent conflict between family members and learns to prioritize maintaining a peaceful atmosphere over expressing their own needs and feelings, effectively silencing their inner world to avoid disruption.  The child's internal dialogue might be, "If I speak up, things will get worse."
* **Example 3:**  A child receives praise and attention primarily for complying with others' wishes and expectations. This reinforces the belief that their value lies in merging with others, rather than in expressing their individuality. The child might think, "I'm only loved when I agree."


**2. Childhood Message (Received):**

The core wound generates a series of internalized messages that reinforce the sense of insignificance and the need to prioritize external harmony over internal needs.

* "Don't make waves."
* "It's easier to go along."
* "Your needs aren't as important."
* "Be agreeable."
* "Don't rock the boat."


**3. Unconscious Belief:**

The core wound and received messages coalesce into an unconscious belief that their inner world is less valuable than the external world, and that their own needs and desires are secondary to maintaining peace and harmony.  This belief manifests as a constant prioritizing of external demands over internal experience. The Nine might think, "My feelings are not as important as keeping everyone happy," or "If I express my needs, it will disrupt the peace."  This isn't a conscious strategy, but an automatic response stemming from the core belief.


**4. Core Fear:**

The Nine experiences a complex interplay of fears, all stemming from the core belief of insignificance and the need to preserve external harmony.

* **Fear of Loss of Connection:**  Driven by the belief that their value is tied to their ability to maintain harmony, Nines fear disrupting relationships, even at the cost of their own needs. Internal dialogue: "If I disagree, they'll leave me."
* **Fear of Conflict:**  Conflict threatens the external peace the Nine strives to maintain, triggering the core wound of insignificance.  Internal experience:  Physical tension, anxiety, and a desire to withdraw.
* **Fear of Disruption:**  Any disturbance to the status quo can be perceived as a threat, leading to a tendency to avoid change and maintain routines.  Internal dialogue: "Things are okay as they are; I shouldn't change anything."
* **Fear of Being Ignored:**  Expressing their needs risks being overlooked or dismissed, reinforcing the core wound.  Internal experience:  Hesitation to speak up, minimizing their own needs.
* **Fear of Anger and Aggression:**  These emotions are perceived as disruptive to harmony and therefore threatening to the Nine's sense of self.  Internal experience:  Suppression of anger, transforming it into passive resistance or resentment.
* **Fear of Separation:**  The Nine fears being separate or distinct, believing their value lies in merging with others.  Internal experience:  Adopting the opinions and preferences of others, losing touch with their own.


**5. Core Desire:**

The Nine's desires are directly related to countering their core fears and reinforcing the unconscious belief that maintaining harmony is essential for their well-being.

* **Desire for Inner Peace:**  Counter to the fear of conflict and disruption, the Nine seeks a state of internal tranquility, often achieved through minimizing their own needs and desires. Example: Feeling calm and content when everyone around them is happy.
* **Desire for Connection:**  Counter to the fear of loss of connection and separation, the Nine craves a sense of belonging and being part of something larger than themselves. Example: Feeling a sense of warmth and security when surrounded by loved ones.
* **Desire for Stability:**  Counter to the fear of disruption, the Nine seeks a predictable and stable environment where they feel safe and secure. Example:  Experiencing comfort in routine and familiarity.
* **Desire for Acceptance:** Counter to the fear of being ignored, the Nine longs to be accepted and valued for who they are, even without asserting themselves. Example: Feeling validated when someone acknowledges their presence and listens to them.
* **Desire for Harmony:**  Counter to the fear of conflict and anger, the Nine desires a peaceful and harmonious environment, both internally and externally. Example: Feeling relaxed and at ease in a calm and agreeable atmosphere.
* **Desire for Oneness:**  Counter to the fear of separation, the Nine desires to merge with others and experience a sense of unity and belonging. Example: Feeling a sense of completion and wholeness when connected to a group or a loved one.



**6. Key Process: Merging (Narcotization):**

Merging, or narcotization, is the Nine's central coping mechanism.  It's an automatic process of minimizing their own needs, desires, and even their sense of self to maintain external harmony and avoid triggering their core fears.  This process develops from the early childhood experiences of being overlooked and the subsequent belief that their inner world is less important.  Merging manifests as a blurring of boundaries between themselves and others, leading to a diminished sense of individuality.  The Nine might think, "It's easier to just agree," or "I don't really have a strong opinion on this." This isn't conscious laziness or apathy, but a non-volitional response to the core fear.


**7. Self-Narcotization Manifestations:**

* **Prioritizing Others' Needs:**  The Nine consistently puts others' needs before their own, even when it causes them discomfort or resentment. Internal experience: Feeling drained and unappreciated, but unable to express their own needs.
* **Avoiding Conflict:**  The Nine goes to great lengths to avoid conflict, even if it means suppressing their own feelings or agreeing to things they don't want. Internal experience: Feeling anxious and tense in situations of potential disagreement.
* **Going Along with the Crowd:**  The Nine readily adopts the opinions and preferences of others, even if they don't align with their own. Internal experience: Feeling disconnected from their own inner world, unsure of their own preferences.
* **Procrastination and Inertia:**  The Nine delays making decisions or taking action, fearing that any choice might disrupt the status quo or lead to conflict. Internal experience: Feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed by the need to choose.
* **Numbing Out:**  The Nine may engage in activities that numb their emotions and disconnect them from their inner world, such as excessive television watching, eating, or sleeping. Internal experience: Feeling detached and disengaged from their own feelings and needs.


**8. Defensive Mechanisms:**

* **Repression:**  The Nine pushes down their own needs and feelings, effectively burying them from conscious awareness. Example:  Not realizing they're angry until it manifests as passive aggression.
* **Rationalization:**  The Nine justifies their inaction or compliance by creating logical explanations that prioritize external harmony over their own needs. Example:  Convincing themselves they actually agree with the group's decision, even if they don't.
* **Minimization:**  The Nine downplays the importance of their own feelings and needs, making them seem insignificant. Example:  Dismissing their own discomfort as "no big deal."
* **Passive Aggression:**  The Nine expresses their suppressed anger and resentment indirectly, through subtle acts of resistance or procrastination. Example:  "Forgetting" to do a task they don't want to do.



**9. Stabilizing Types/Integration and Disintegration Points:**

* **Integration (Moving towards Three):**  When moving towards health, the Nine begins to connect with their own inner world and assert their needs and desires. They experience increased energy, focus, and a sense of personal power.  Internal dialogue shifts from "I don't matter" to "I have something valuable to contribute."
* **Disintegration (Moving towards Six):** Under stress, the Nine's fears intensify, leading to increased anxiety, indecisiveness, and a heightened need for external reassurance.  Internal dialogue becomes filled with doubt and worry: "What if I make the wrong decision?" "What if they don't like me?"




**10. Type's Trap:**

The Nine's trap is the belief that their own needs and desires are insignificant and that their value lies solely in maintaining external harmony.  This leads to a cycle of self-neglect and resentment.  Internal dialogue: "I'll just go along with it this time," which evolves into "Why am I always the one who gives in?"  This reinforces the core wound and perpetuates the cycle.


**11. Levels of Health:**

* **Level 1 (Pathological):**  Severe detachment from reality, merging with others to the point of losing their sense of self. Internal experience:  Confusion, apathy, and a sense of emptiness.
* **Level 2:**  Passive-aggressive resistance, stubbornness, and a tendency to merge with unhealthy or destructive influences. Internal experience:  Resentment, frustration, and a sense of being trapped.
* **Level 3:**  Complacency, procrastination, and a focus on superficial harmony. Internal experience:  Apathy, boredom, and a sense of being stuck.
* **Level 4:**  Increased awareness of their own needs and desires, but still struggling to assert them. Internal experience:  Frustration, guilt, and a sense of being pulled in multiple directions.
